## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### **Brain-Computer Interface Security**

Since BrainPower processes neural data, we take security seriously:

#### **Data Protection**

- All EEG data stays local by default
- No automatic cloud uploads
- User controls all data export
- Trained models remain on user's device

#### **Hardware Security**

- Secure communication with OpenBCI devices
- Input validation for all serial data
- Protection against malformed data packets

#### **Privacy**

- No personally identifiable information collected
- Brain patterns are anonymized
- Users control all data sharing

### **Software Security**

#### **Input Validation**

- All user inputs are validated
- Serial data is sanitized
- File paths are validated

#### **Dependencies**

- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning of requirements
- Minimal external dependencies

#### **Code Safety**

- No execution of user-provided code
- Safe pickle loading with validation
- Protected file operations

## 🔍 Security Best Practices for Users

### **Installation Security**

- Always install from official sources
- Verify package integrity
- Use virtual environments
- Keep dependencies updated

### **Usage Security**

- Keep trained models private
- Be cautious sharing EEG data
- Use strong file permissions
- Regularly update the software

### **Hardware Security**

- Secure your OpenBCI device
- Use proper electrode hygiene
- Protect against electromagnetic interference

## 🚫 Out of Scope

The following are generally NOT considered security vulnerabilities:

- Issues requiring physical access to the device
- Attacks requiring user to install malicious software
- Issues in dependencies (report to upstream)
- Performance issues or resource exhaustion
- Issues requiring social engineering
